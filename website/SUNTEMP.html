                 Not very far from the famous beach town of Puri, the Sun Temple at Konark is a 13th-century temple situated in Konark, Odisha.<br>
                 It was built by King Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty in around AD 1250. <br>
                 The Sun Temple is in the shape of a gigantic chariot with carved stone wheel, pillars and walls and is led by six enormously carved horses.<br> 
                 Itâ€™s also considered to be one of the largest brahmin sanctuaries in India. <br>
                 The temple is originally said to be built at the mouth of river Chandrabhaga .<br>
                 This World Heritage Site in India reflects the grandeur of the traditional style of Kalinga Architecture, which was prevalent then.<br>
