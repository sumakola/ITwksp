               1)The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of Shah Jahan.<br>
               2)Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, adjacent to an older fort, Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546.<br>
               3)The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel-Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise).<br>
               4)The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity.<br>
               5)The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building.<br>
               6)The Red Fort’s innovative planning and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens.<br>
               7)This palace fortress is known as the Red Fort because of the red sandstone fabric of its rampart walls.<br>
